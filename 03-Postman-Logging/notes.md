# Logging in Node Environment

- Logging in Node.js refers to the practice of recording information about the execution of an application.
- This information can include errors, warnings, informational messages, and debugging details.
- Effective logging is essential for monitoring the health and performance of an application, diagnosing issues, and understanding user behavior.
- Node.js provides several ways to implement logging, ranging from basic console logging to using advanced logging libraries.

## Importance of Logging

1. Debugging: Logs help developers diagnose and troubleshoot issues by providing a record of events leading up to an error or unexpected behavior.
2. Monitoring: Logs provide insight into the application's runtime behavior, helping to monitor performance, resource usage, and user interactions.
3. Auditing: Logs can be used to track significant events, such as user actions or system changes, which is important for security and compliance.
4. Alerting: Logs can trigger alerts when certain conditions are met, enabling proactive management of potential issues.

## Types of Logs

1. Error Logs: Record error messages when exceptions or failures occur.
2. Warning Logs: Record potentially problematic situations that do not stop the execution but may need attention.
3. Info Logs: Provide informational messages about the normal operation of the application.
4. Debug Logs: Contain detailed diagnostic information useful during development and debugging.
5. Audit Logs: Track user actions and significant system events for security and compliance purposes.

## Basic Logging

- The simplest form of logging in Node.js is using the built-in console object:

```
console.log('This is an info message');
console.error('This is an error message');
console.warn('This is a warning message');
console.debug('This is a debug message');

```

- While console logging is useful for quick debugging, it is not suitable for production use due to lack of features like log levels, formatting, and output destinations.

## Advanced Node logging

- 'Morgan' and 'Winston' are two popular logging libraries in the Node.js ecosystem, each serving different purposes and use cases.

### Morgon

- Morgan is a middleware for HTTP request logging in Node.js applications, commonly used with Express.js.
- It is primarily designed to log HTTP requests and responses in a predefined format, making it easy to track and analyze incoming traffic to your application.

#### Key Features:

1. Predefined Formats: Morgan supports several predefined logging formats, such as 'combined', 'common', 'dev', 'short', and 'tiny'.
2. Custom Formats: You can define custom logging formats to suit your specific needs.
3. Stream Support: Morgan can write logs to a stream, such as a file or the console.
4. Immediate Logging: Option to log requests immediately before they are handled by your application.

### Winston

- Winston is a versatile logging library for Node.js that allows for logging messages at different levels of severity (e.g., info, warn, error) and outputting them to various transports (e.g., console, file, HTTP, database).
- Winston is highly configurable and is suitable for both simple and complex logging requirements.

#### Key Features:

1. Multiple Transports: Support for logging to multiple destinations such as files, console, databases, and remote servers.
2. Log Levels: Customizable log levels with the ability to define severity levels and their colors.
3. Formatters: Allows for custom formatting of log messages.
4. Asynchronous Logging: Handles logging asynchronously, which can improve performance.
5. Flexible Configuration: Easily configure loggers, transports, and formats.

- We can combine Morgan and Winston to handle both HTTP request logging and general application logging.
- For example, we can use Morgan to log HTTP requests and route those logs through Winston for additional processing or output:

### Installation

- To install Winston and Morgan , we can use the following command:

  > npm install winston morgan

- This will install the winston and morgan packages, which are used to configure and use the Winston logger.

### Configuration

- To configure Winston, we can create a new file called `logger.js` in the root directory of our project.
- The code in logger.js file configures `Winston` to log messages to the console and a file called app.log.
- It also sets the log `level` to `info` and uses the `colorize` and `timestamp` formatters to add colors and timestamps to the console logs.

### Usage

- To use the Winston logger, we can import it in your code and use it as follows:
- First, go to your [index.js file ](./index.js) and setup the winston morgan
- This will log the messages to the console and the file app.log.
- The morgan package is used to format the log messages and the stream option is used to write the log messages to the console.

### Easy log messages

- To use the Winston logger, we can import it in your code and use it as follows:

  ```
  import logger from './logger';

  logger.info('This is an info message');
  logger.error('This is an error message');
  logger.warn('This is a warning message');
  logger.debug('This is a debug message');
  ```

- This will log the messages to the console and the file app.log.

## Environment Variables Configuration

- `Dotenv` is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env.
- Storing configuration in the environment separate from code is based on The Twelve-Factor App methodology.

#### Steps to configure :

1. npm i dotenv
2. import 'dotenv/config'
3. Create a .env file in the root of your project
4. Define the environment variables (in our case) PORT
5. Add those variables in the code, where they are required.
